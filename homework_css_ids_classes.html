        }

        a:hover {
            background-color: purple;
            color: white;
            border: 5px solid pink;
        }

     <p>Man is conditioned from the begining of his life to think that the world he lives in has absolute material reality. Man only knows the 
         world as it is presented by his 5 senses. Yet scientific research shows that the soul is a metephysical being that uses the brain to see
         and feel. What we call the material world is an aggregate of percepions viewed and felt by this soul. Just as the bodies we possess and 
         the material world we see in our dreams have no physical reality the universe we occupy and the bodies now also have no physical reality.
         If the thing we acknowledged to be the matrial world is merely comprised of perceptions given to our soul then what is the source of these
         perception. Matter does not have a self-governing existence by itself therefore this perception must have been caused by another power which
         means that it must have been created moreover this creation must be continuous. If there were not a continuous and consistent creation 
         then what we call matter would disappear. So it is evident that there is a superior creator who has created the entire material universe that
         is the sum of all perceptions and continues his creation ceaselessly. Since this creator displays such a magnificent creation he surely has
         eternal power and might. This creator is Allah.
